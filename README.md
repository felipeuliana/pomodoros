# Pomodoros

Repository of text files to manage and put on practice _The Pomodoro Technique_:

## The _Activity Inventory_ sheet

This sheet consists of:

- A heading with the name of the author;

- A number of lines where various activities are noted down as they come up. At the end of the day, the ones that have been completed are checked off.

## The _To Do Today_ sheet

This sheet is filled in at the start of each day with the following:

- A heading with place, date and author;

- A list of the things to do during the day, in order of priority.

- A section labelled _Unplanned & Urgent Activities_ where any unexpected tasks that have to be dealt with should be listed as they come up. These activities could potentially modify the day’s plan.

- Making a _To Do Today_ list each day focuses the mind.

## The _Records_ sheet

This sheet contains the set of raw data needed to produce pernient reports and graphics. Depending on the objectives in question, this contains different set of boxes.

Normally this sheet would include the date, description and the number of Pomodoros worth of effort needed to accomplish a task.

This sheet is updated at least once a day, usually at the end of the day.

## The Pomodoro Technique _Cheat Sheet_

### What is it?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any kind of task. For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by _“the ticking clock”_, especially when a deadline is involved, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.

The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to continually improve the way we work or study.

### The goals

 The Pomodoro Technique will provide a simple _tool/process_ for improving productivity (your own and that of your team members) which is able to do the following:

 - Alleviate anxiety linked to becoming;

 - Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions;

 - Increase awareness of your decisions;

 - Boost motivation and keep it constant;

 - Bolster the determination to achieve your goals;

 - Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms;

 - Improve your work or study process;

 - Strengthen your determination to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex situations.

### Interruptions

Once you’ve started using the Pomodoro Technique, interruptions can become a real problem.

_Internal interruptions_ are distractions that come from you: stand up and get some-thing to eat or drink or to look up some-thing on the Internet this minute.

Make these interruptions clearly visible. Every time you feel a potential interrup-tion coming on, put an apostrophe (’) on the sheet where you record your Pomodoros.

Then do one of the following:

- Write down the new activity on the __To Do Sheet__ under _Unplanned & Urgent_ if you think it’s imminent and can’t be put off;

- Write it down in the __Activity Inventory Sheet__, marking it with a _“U”_ (unplanned); add a deadline if need be;

- Intensify your determination to finish the current Pomodoro. Once you’ve marked down the apostrophe, continue working on the given task till the Pomodoro rings.

People who work in social environments have to deal with _external interruptions_: a colleague asks you how to compile a report; an email program constantly beeps every time a new message comes in. A 25-minute or 2-hour delay (four Pomodoros) is almost always possible for activities that are commonly considered urgent.

Make these interruptions clearly visible. Every time someone or something tries to interrupt a Pomodoro, put a dash (-) on the sheet where you record your Pomodoros, apply the _Inform, Negotiate, and Call Strategy_. Then apply one of the rules exposed above for internal interruptions.
